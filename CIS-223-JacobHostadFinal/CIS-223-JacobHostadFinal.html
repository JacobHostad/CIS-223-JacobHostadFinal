    This was made using the Phaser Game Engine. Phaser provides many tools built into it to help streamline the creation of web games, such as a built in physics engine, which was used a lot in this project, and easy collision mechanics. 
    Throughout my time using this tool I learned that it really does most of the background work for you, you only need to tell it what to do, which sometimes is made a little difficult by the fact that some of the older sources on the site no longer seem compatible with newer code.
    Most of the beginner topics were pretty easy to implement, as I needed variables for just about every object in this game, if else statements were very necessary for giving movement to my character, and while I scrapped it would have been useful in giving the player projectiles of their own,
    and iteration was used for the scoring, and subsequently the bomb spawning system.  Arrays were also used a lot, as they were necessary for the base framework of setting up the engine, making the WASD keys usable for movement, and to an extent for the bombs.
    Lastly, objects were used quite often as well, as I needed to modify the properties of most of the objects to give them collision.

// a majority of the base code in this first section where I'm setting things up can be found here: https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/making-your-first-phaser-game , I found this through the phaser website, couldn't find who the specific author was only that it's owned by Phaser, as far as beginning and end of example code I can't say for certain, the bombs.create function is modified from the example, a majority of the framework (config, the start of each of the 3 scenes) was in the tutorial but would have had to be done regardless, and creating the platforms and player were a good chunk from the tutorial.
